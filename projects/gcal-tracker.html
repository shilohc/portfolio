                    This is a simple command-line utility that displays time breakdowns for the tasks on your Google Calendar, grouped by calendar and optionally by name.  For example, I can compute the total time of the events in my calendar for 6.832 (Underactuated Robotics) for the past week, and also check what portion of this time was spent on homework or in class.  
                    </p>
                    <p>I wrote this to track how much time I spend on each of my classes, but it's flexible enough to be useful as a generic time tracker for contractors billing by the hour, interns working an hourly wage, or anyone else that wants to check how they're spending their time.  You can find it on my github <a href="https://github.com/shilohc/gcal-tracker">here</a>.
