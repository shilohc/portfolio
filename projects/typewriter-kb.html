                    This is a mechanical keyboard build (DZ60 PCB, Kailh BOX Navy switches) that uses as its keycaps real keys from old typewriters.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I used three different sets of vintage typewriter keys.  The alpha keys and some of the modifiers are glass tombstone-style keys from a vintage Royal mechanical typewriter, but since that's only 50 keys, I augmented it with plastic keys from two different sets (origin unknown).  (Fun fact: Old typewriters -- including the Royal that my keys are from -- often didn't come with a '1' key; instead, the digit '1' was typed using a lowercase 'l'.)  These keys came with part of the typewriter stem still attached to the back, which I had to trim to a reasonable length.  I dremeled a few, but it was taking forever, so I used a sheet metal hand nibbler on the rest and gave myself a wicked hand cramp.

                    <p>
                    Next I designed (in OnShape) and 3D-printed adapters for these keys that would fit on the Cherry MX switches, which I hot-glued to the typewriter keys.  I ended up designing six or so types of adapters -- some of the metal keys had wider stems than the others, a few came without stems, and of course each set of plastic keys needed its own type of adapter.

                    I didn't really think far enough ahead to design and lasercut a custom plate, so I decided to do a plateless build with PCB-mount switches.  Problem: Kailh BOX Navy switches aren't PCB-mount.  (PCB-mount switches have, in addition to the two metal switch pins, two plastic pins that fit into holes on the PCB for added rigidity.)  Therefore, I hot-glued them to the PCB.  A lot of hot glue was involved in this build.

                    The final step was flashing the keyboard firmware.  Thankfully, the DZ60 is one of the incredibly many keyboards supported by the open-source QMK keyboard firmware.  I tweaked one of the standard layouts a bit, since I'm using a somewhat weird split-spacebar layout with arrow keys.  I also customized the underglow LED lighting and started adding some interesting layers.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    There's still a lot more to be done with this project.  My next step is to 3D-print a case, something I haven't yet gotten a chance to do.  I also want to work on layer functionality some more; QMK is really powerful and I'm excited to see what I can do with it.  (Maybe I'll make a copypasta layer so I can easily use my favorite kaomoji, くコ:彡 and ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.  More practically, I also want a layer that will map the arrow keys, Page Down, etc. to the corresponding vim keybindings.)
